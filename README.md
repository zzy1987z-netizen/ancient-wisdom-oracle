# Ancient Wisdom Oracle (Android App Concept)

This is a functional concept for an Android application that re-imagines the traditional Chinese divination ritual for a modern audience. More than just a simple fortune-telling app, this project explores complex, non-linear user experiences and the creative integration of AI-generated content.

The project was built independently to demonstrate end-to-end development capabilities, from conceptual design and algorithmic logic to a feature-complete user interface.

## Core Features & Design Philosophy

*   **Immersive Cultural Journey:**
    *   **Contextual Onboarding:** The app begins with an introduction to the cultural background, including the origins of the ritual and the biography of the deity Lü Zu, setting a respectful and informed tone.
    *   **Animated Ritual:** A key feature is the animated incense-burning ceremony, designed to create a moment of calm and focus before the core experience.

*   **Unique Algorithmic Logic (The "Path of Sincerity"):**
    *   The divination process is not based on simple, direct randomness. It incorporates a unique, multi-layered algorithm to simulate the classical concept of requiring a sincere heart:
        1.  **Primary Chance (0-1 Test):** The user's first attempt has a chance to succeed directly.
        2.  **Moment of Reflection:** If the first attempt fails (a result of '0'), the app doesn't just ask the user to try again. Instead, it presents a random, profound classical Chinese quote, prompting a moment of reflection.
        3.  **Path of Deeper Wisdom:** If the user fails three consecutive times, the app guides them to a full chapter from the Tao Te Ching, suggesting a need for deeper wisdom before proceeding.
        4.  **Guaranteed Outcome:** After this journey, the user is then guaranteed to receive a divination result, rewarding their persistence.

*   **AI-Enhanced Interpretation (Ancient Wisdom, Modern Comfort):**
    *   **Dual-Layered Results:** Upon receiving a fortune stick, the user is first presented with the original, classical oracle poem.
    *   **AI-Generated Insight:** A key innovation is the "AI-Compiled Modern Interpretation." This feature uses generative AI to provide a supportive, empathetic, and psychologically comforting explanation of the ancient text, functioning as a form of "spiritual massage."

*   **Standard User-Centric Features:**
    *   Includes essential functionalities for users to save (favorite) and share their results.
